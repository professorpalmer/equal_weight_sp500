This is a simple python based, automated-investment strategy for the S&P 500.

When you run this python script it will scrape Wiki for the names in the S&P 500, reference yfinance for their price/weight/market cap, and then export the suggested portfolio adjustments to an excel document.
Once you input portfolio's total value, it will determine the correct amount of shares to buy per ticker in order to mimic the equal weight of the securities within the S&P 500.
